          Theme Selection: The colour theme for the website based on the French
          flag colors. This choice was decided based on the client's desires and
          requests gathered in the client interview held earlier this term. The
          choice to go for a French feeling on the website comes from the kind
          of establishment the client has and the user experience the client
          wanted for it. Used light colors for the background to prevent
          distractions from the users when navigating it so that they can focus
          on the content and products while also respecting the French flag,
          which has the colour white in it.

          The layout was based on the best common practices for business
          websites. Used a clean design throughout all pages to let the content
          of the website shine. Another reason for using a clean design was to
          give a feeling of a sophisticated place, being beautiful and intuitive
          yet simple. <br />
          Went with a zig-zag layout for the Home, Contact Us, and About Our
          Restaurant pages, alternating in which side content is with each
          content block. Used a split-screen layout for the drinks and crepes
          menu pages, conveying all information in two different columns. Used a
          grid for the gallery page to let the users see all photos in small
          sizes and choose any of them to see it in a bigger size, in a way
          similar to various other websites, for example, YouTube.
