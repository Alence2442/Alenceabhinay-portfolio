        <h2>Project Plan</h2>
        <p>
          The project plan for the "Les CrÃªpes" coffee shop website encompasses
          meticulous stages of planning, design, development, and an
          orchestrated launch. The primary objective is to create an engaging
          online platform that accurately represents the charm and offerings of
          the coffee shop while providing users with an intuitive and
          informative experience.

        <h2>Design Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Theme Selection: The colour theme for the website based on the French
          flag colors. This choice was decided based on the client's desires and
          requests gathered in the client interview held earlier this term. The
          choice to go for a French feeling on the website comes from the kind
          of establishment the client has and the user experience the client
          wanted for it. Used light colors for the background to prevent
          distractions from the users when navigating it so that they can focus
          on the content and products while also respecting the French flag,
          which has the colour white in it.
          <br />
          <a target="_blank" href="images/logos/Les Crepes.png"
            ><img src="images/logos/Les Crepes.png" alt="RoadMap" width="30%"
          /></a>
          <br />
          The layout was based on the best common practices for business
          websites. Used a clean design throughout all pages to let the content
          of the website shine. Another reason for using a clean design was to
          give a feeling of a sophisticated place, being beautiful and intuitive
          yet simple. <br />
          Went with a zig-zag layout for the Home, Contact Us, and About Our
          Restaurant pages, alternating in which side content is with each
          content block. Used a split-screen layout for the drinks and crepes
          menu pages, conveying all information in two different columns. Used a
          grid for the gallery page to let the users see all photos in small
          sizes and choose any of them to see it in a bigger size, in a way
          similar to various other websites, for example, YouTube.

        <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <ul>
            Requirments: Have the same French theme atmosphere as the restaurant.
            <br />Derived req: The colors of the French flag will be used and
            respected on the website. <br />How we achieved it: The website uses
            elements, like the footer and buttons, with a blue colour that
            matches the French flag blue. It also uses some specific texts in
            the same red colour as the French flag as well. Both of them are
            used with less opacity, so it maintains the sophisticated feel of
            the website.
          </ul><br />
          <ul>
            Primary Requirments: Showcase restaurant through a gallery<br />Derived
            req: We will use pictures from the restaurant given to us by the
            client.<br />How we achieved it: The gallery page is well organized
            and can show everything the client wants. All media used in this
            project is stock media, easily replaceable for the client's custom
            pictures and images.
          </ul><br />
          <ul>
            Contact and location information<br />Derived req: Put
            contact information text visible for the user and pin the restaurant
            location on the Google map embedded on the site.<br />How we
            achieved it: A website page is dedicated to giving users the contact
            and location information for the crepery. The phone number is also
            in the header of all pages. As for the embedded google maps, it was
            put in the website's footer instead of being only on this specific
            page.
          </ul><br />
          <ul>
            Create a logo with French icons and flag colours<br />Derived
            req: The colors of the French flag will be used and respected on the
            logo. Icons relating to French landmarks will be used.<br />How we
            achieved it: The logo was created using the French flag and the
            Eifel Tower, instantly bringing the French element to it. It also
            features a coffee mug and some brown background colours, which waves
            to the kind of products the crepery sells.
          </ul><br />
          <ul>
            Menu and product showcase<br />Derived req: Showing
            products and prices the restaurant has to offer. According to the
            client, the menus will have 3 to 4 pictures.<br />How we achieved
            it: For the restaurant menu, we did two different pages. One only
            with the crepes and another just with drinks. We used one image for
            each of these pages, describing all products according to the
            information the client gave us.
          </ul><br />
          <ul>
            Highlight some premium, most popular products on the
            menu<br />Derived req: Showing products and prices the restaurant
            has to offer. According to the client, the menus will have 3 to 4
            pictures. Showcase this premium section in a highlighted area.<br />How
            we achieved it: Any product that the client may want to highlight
            can be put as the image on the menu pages. The products can also be
            shown on the home page and even on the gallery page.
